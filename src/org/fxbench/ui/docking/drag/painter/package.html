Contains the functionality for painting a representation of the {@link com.javadocking.dockable.Dockable}, 
when it is dragged. The basic interface is {@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.DockableDragPainter}.
</p>
<p>
Information on using dockable drag painters is in 
<a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/drag.html" target="_blank">How to Use Dragging</a> in
<i>The Sanaware Developer Guide</i>.
</p>
<p>
Usually the representation for a dragged dockable is a rectangle.
It shows where the dockable will be docked in a {@link com.javadocking.dock.Dock}, 
if the mouse would be released at the current mouse position.
This rectangle can be painted with a {@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.RectanglePainter}:
<ul>
<li>on the glass pane ({@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.SwDockableDragPainter}),</li>
<li>on a window ({@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.WindowDockableDragPainter}),</li>
<li>or on a transparent window ({@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.TransparentWindowDockableDragPainter}).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Different drag painters can be combined with the {@link com.javadocking.drag.painter.CompositeDockableDragPainter}.
