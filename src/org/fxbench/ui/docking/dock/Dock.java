/**
 * <p>
 * A dock is where {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dockable.Dockable}s can be docked.
 * How a dockable is docked in the dock, depends on the location where the dockable is added.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are docks that have child docks ({@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dock.CompositeDock}s) 
 * and there are docks that only contain dockables ({@link LeafDock}s). 
 * The UI of an application contains tree structures of docks. Every dock
 * has a parent composite dock. The parent composite dock of the root dock is null.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Information on using docks is in 
 * <a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/leafdock.html" target="_blank">How to Use Laef Docks</a> and 
 * <a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/compositedock.html" target="_blank">How to Use Composite Docks</a> in 
 * <i>The Sanaware Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A dock can be empty. This means that it doesn't have any dockables docked in it, or it doesn't have any child docks if it is a composite dock. 
 * If a dock becomes empty, it should inform the parent composite dock, that it is empty. 
 * A parent composite dock can then decide to remove the empty child dock. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A dock can also be full. This means that no dockables can be added. If a composite dock is full,
 * no child docks can be added. This does not necessarily mean that all of its child docks are full! 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a dockable is dragged, depending on the location of the mouse, the dockable can be docked 
 * in different ways in the dock. For example,
 * if the location is at the left side of a dock, the dockable can be docked left. if the location is in the center 
 * of a dock, the dockable can be docked in the center. Every mouse location has a priority for docking
 * a dockable. The priority constants are defined in {@link Priority}.
