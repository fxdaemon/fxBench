Contains the interfaces and implementations for docks. 
</p>
<p>
Docks can contain {@link com.javadocking.dockable.Dockable}s or other docks.
The dockables can be moved from one dock to another dock.
The docks stay always on the same place.
</p>
<p>
The main interface for a dock is {@link com.javadocking.dock.Dock}.
There are 2 important extensions of this interface: {@link com.javadocking.dock.LeafDock}
and {@link com.javadocking.dock.CompositeDock}.
</p>
<p>
Information on using docks is in 
<a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/leafdock.html" target="_blank">How to Use Laef Docks</a> and 
<a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/compositedock.html" target="_blank">How to Use Composite Docks</a> in 
<i>The Sanaware Developer Guide</i>.
</p>
<p>
A leaf dock is a dock that contains dockables.
A composite dock is a dock 
that contains other docks.
</p>
<p>
Some implementations of leaf docks are:
<ul>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.SingleDock} can contain 0 or one dockables.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.TabDock} can contain multiple dockables that are ordered in tabs of a tabbed pane.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.LineDock} can contain multiple dockables that are ordered in a line.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.GridDock} can contain multiple dockables that are ordered in a grid.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some implementations of composite docks are:
<ul>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.SplitDock} can contain 0, 1 or 2 docks. 
	When there are 2 docks they are organized in a splitt pane.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.BorderDock} contains at least one dock in the center. It can also contain
	a dock in the north, south, east and west.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.CompositeLineDock} can contain multiple docks that are ordered in a line.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.CompositeGridDock} can contain multiple docks that are ordered in a grid.</li>
<li>A {@link com.javadocking.dock.FloatDock} can contain multiple docks that are organized in floating windows.</li>
</ul>
