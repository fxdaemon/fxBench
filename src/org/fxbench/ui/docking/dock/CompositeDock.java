 * <i>The Sanaware Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Child docks can be added. They can not be removed explicitly. When a child dock is empty, the method
 * {@link #emptyChild(Dock)} of the composite parent dock has to be called. The parent dock can then remove the child.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Dockables can also be added with the method {@link Dock#addDockable(org.fxbench.ui.docking.dockable.Dockable, java.awt.Point, java.awt.Point)}.
 * When this dockable is added, a child dock is created with the child dock factory, retrieved by 
 * {@link #getChildDockFactory()}. The dockable is added to this child dock, and the child dock is added to this composite dock.
