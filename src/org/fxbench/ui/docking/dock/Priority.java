/**
 * <p>
 * This class defines the integer constants for the priority for adding 
 * a dockable to a specific dock.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Depending on the location of the mouse above the dock, when dragging a dockable, 
 * a dockable can be docked in different ways in the dock.
 * Every location has a priority for docking a dockable. 
 * If a dockable cannot be docked at all, the priority is CANNOT_DOCK. Other possible priority values 
 * with ascending priority are CAN_DOCK_AS_LAST, CAN_DOCK, CAN_DOCK_WITH_PRIORITY and CAN_DOCK_WITH_HIGH_PRIORITY.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible that a dockable can be docked in multiple docks for the same screen location. In that case the dock
 * that has the highest priority, will be chosen.
 * </p>
