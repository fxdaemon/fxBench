 * <p>
 * This kind of event is broad-casted when the structure of docks and dockables change in a dock model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Dockables or child docks can be added, moved or removed. An event will be broad-casted before and
 * after the change.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are 4 different kinds of docking events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a dockable or child dock is added, the origin dock is null.</li>
 * <li>When a dockable or child dock is removed, the destination dock is null.</li>
 * <li>When a dockable or child dock is moved in its dock, the origin dock and destination dock are equal.</li>
 * <li>When a dockable or child dock is moved to another dock, the origin dock and destination dock are different.</li>
 * </ul>
