 * This path can be an existing path in a {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.model.DockModel}. It can be also a path that describes how a dockable that is

 * A dock model can contain several docking trees. This docking path

 * A dockable that is docked in a {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dock.LeafDock} has a specific position 
 * in that dock. A dock that is docked in another

 * This docking path contains also this information.
