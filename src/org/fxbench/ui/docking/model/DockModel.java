/**
 * <p>
 * A dock model represents a collection of docks that are used in an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Information on using dock models is in 
 * <a href="http://www.javadocking.com/developerguide/dockmodel.html" target="_blank">How to Use Dock Models</a> in 
 * <i>The Sanaware Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The dock model should be given to the docking manager with the method: 
 * {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.DockingManager#setDockModel(DockModel)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This model is a collection of trees of docks: <ul> 
 * <li>The deepest docks of every tree are {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dock.LeafDock}s.</li> 
 * <li>The leaf docks contain the {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dockable.Dockable}s.</li>
 * <li>The ancestors of these leaf docks are {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dock.CompositeDock}s.</li> 
 * <li>The composite docks whose parents are null, are the root docks.</li>  
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This dock model contains the root docks. All docks of the model have one of the root docks as root. 
 * Every root dock of the model can be retrieved with a key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For every root dock the owner window has to be specified. 
 * If the dock is a java.awt.Component, then the root dock should be its window ancestor.
 * If the dock is a {@link org.fxbench.ui.docking.dock.FloatDock}, then the owner is the window that will own
 * the floating windows.
